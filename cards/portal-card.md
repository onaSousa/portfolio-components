# Portal card
**A component that I needed to create for a layout of a city hall transparency portal**

Design is very important to convey the idea and bring visitors closer to the platform,
<br>making them not only perform the "task" they came after, they are also satisfied with the experience of use they had, 
<br>either because it was easy, because they found it the solution, etc.

One more challenge for the designer is also to transmit to the front-end in a practical and uncomplicated way 
<br>the best way to apply the design to the project, so I tried to show my apprentice that this part was 
<br>doing all the details necessary to have a good final result.

Thus, using *Figma* to design the layout and the possibility of making available all the details of CSS attributes 
<br>and complementing with this information in the layout about spacing and other details.
